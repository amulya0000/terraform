Here are the key interview questions with short-form answers:

1. **Why is Terraform an important skill for DevOps and Cloud Engineers?**
   - Terraform provides a universal approach to infrastructure automation across multiple cloud providers.
   - As cloud infrastructure becomes more complex, efficient and reproducible tools like Terraform are increasingly in demand.

2. **What is the difference between IaC tools like Terraform and cloud-specific tools?**
   - IaC tools like Terraform are provider-agnostic, while cloud-specific tools (e.g., CloudFormation) are tied to a single cloud platform.
   - Terraform's universal approach reduces the need to learn multiple provider-specific tools.

3. **Explain the Terraform workflow and the purpose of the key commands.**
   - `terraform init` sets up the Terraform configuration, `terraform plan` previews changes, `terraform apply` creates/updates infrastructure, and `terraform destroy` removes infrastructure.

4. **Why is cloud provider knowledge important when using Terraform?**
   - Terraform relies on the cloud provider's APIs and resources, so understanding the provider's concepts is crucial for effective Terraform usage and troubleshooting.

5. **Explain the purpose and importance of the Terraform state file.**
   - The state file tracks the resources Terraform has created and their current state, maintaining consistency and allowing Terraform to understand the infrastructure.

6. **What are the advantages of using a tool like Code Spaces for Terraform development?**
   - Code Spaces provides a pre-configured Terraform development environment, removing the need for local setup and providing a consistent, reproducible workspace.
